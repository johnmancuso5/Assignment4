The TipCalculator takes in 2 inputs and calculates the tips at a certain percent. The tip is calculated per person and the total for the group.

The inputs are for the check amount and party size. A Error Message will pop up on the android phone if the values of these inputs are less than 0 or null.

Run the phone emulator or use an android phone to run the application. Once ran, you will be prompt with to input the necessary data and it will display below the Compute Tip button.

The UI was setup for phones that are in 1080 x 1920 (Pixel 2).
